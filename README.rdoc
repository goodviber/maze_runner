== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is a rails app, which generates a maze and uses a recursive pattern to solve the maze in javascript.

I have not gotten around to preparing a test suit with rspec/jasmine, but may return to it in the future.

The door is marked "2" and the exit "3". The walls are "1"s and the path is "0"s.
